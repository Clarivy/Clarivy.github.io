      <description>Why We Need AI Assistance 我们为何需要 AI 的帮助 在面临信息爆炸的时代，CourseBench 专注于为所有学生提供一个公平、独立的课程评价平台。但随着用户数量的增长，我们遇到了一些挑战。各种投诉、举报和学校约谈不仅消耗我们的大量时间和精力，更重要的是，我们坚信每一个声音都应该被听到，每一条评价都有其存在的价值。因此，我们开发了 CourseBench AI，以 AI 的力量来帮助我们实现这个目标。

Various complaints, reports, and meetings with schools not only consume a lot of our time and energy, but more importantly, we firmly believe that every voice should be heard and every review has its value.</description>
